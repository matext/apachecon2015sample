# apachecon2015sample
Sample Code from my presentation at ApacheCon for using UIMA to analyze sentiment of tweets then dump into elastic search. 


## NOTE
The demo code I wrote used a sentiment analyzer that is not compatible with the Apache License. So in order
to post the examples, I gutted all links to the library and create a stub instead in the SentimentAnalyzer Analytic
Engine.

# Dependencies
All requirements are in the pom.xml
